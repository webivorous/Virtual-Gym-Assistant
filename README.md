# Virtual-Gym-Assistant
Final Year Capstone Project - Virtual Gym Assistant

## Abstract

Engaging in physical exercises such as weight 
training and physiotherapy stretching exercises generally require the assistance of a personal trainer to assist the user with 
proper execution and awareness of the exercises. One of the main problems in engaging in exercises by ourselves is that there is no proper guidance and feedback provided to align the exercises to the correct movements due to the absence of a physical trainer.
## Objective

The purpose of this project is to build a machine learning-based Gym Assistant to better assist the user in performing physical exercises in the absence of the physical trainer
